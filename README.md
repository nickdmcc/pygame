# pygame

Trying to use cx_Freeze to create an executable for this is not working for me. I am missing some files I'll get to later. To run this locally, you will need to install pygame.

I used pip for python 3.6, and the command was:
pip install pygame

Once that is installed, you should be able to use (from the folder game.py is in):
py game.py
